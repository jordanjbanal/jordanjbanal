### Hi there, I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹

I am 23 and I am based in Montreal, QC in Canada, but origianlly from France.
I am bilingual - Native in French and fluent in English.

I am an autodidact. I like building and learning new things by starting, doing and fixing.

I am interested in Object-Oriented programming and Back-End Development.
I am currently learning C# and building project with Visual Studio.

My very first project called tetechercheuse.sln is a Windows Form Application I built for my photographer girlfriend. She wants to be able to record her models into a database, search through them according to some criteria such as location and eye color. My application does just that: It helps her retrieve her previously inserted model information with criteria-filtering queries.

I aim to develop beautiful and useful applications for the end users to make their best use of.
