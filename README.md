### Hi there, I'm Jay 👋

I am 23 and I am based in Montreal, QC in Canada, but originally from France.
I am bilingual - native in French and fluent in English.

I am an autodidact. I like building and learning new things by starting, doing and fixing.

I have proudly graduated from the prestigious Data Science Bootcamp at Concordia University where I acquired the necessary knowledge and skills to become successful as a Data Scientist. I am actively seeking a data science position in Canada.

I also completed a Bachelor's Degree in Commerce majoring in Business Technology Management from the John Molson School of Business during which I took some programming introduction courses leading me to exploit my full potential by choosing the Bootcamp route.

I aim to develop beautiful-made and useful applications for end users to gain efficiency within their lives, be it personally or professionally.
I am interested in contributing to helping projects other than my own. Hit me up anytime.

I am interested in mobile app development and video game development. 
My goal is to become a Back-End Developer.
I am currently learning C# and building project with Visual Studio.

My very first project in programming is called tetechercheuse.sln which is a Windows Form Application I built for my photographer girlfriend. She wanted to be able to record the models she is working with into a database and search through them according to some criteria such as location and eye color. My application does just that: It helps her retrieve her previously inserted model information with criteria-filtering queries.
