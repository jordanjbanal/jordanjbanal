### Hi there, I'm Jay 👋

I am 23 and I am based in Montreal, QC in Canada, but originally from France.
I am bilingual - native in French and fluent in English.

I am an autodidact. I like building and learning new things by starting, doing and fixing.

I am interested in mobile app development and video game development. 
My goal is to become a Back-End Developer.
I am currently learning C# and building project with Visual Studio.

My very first project in programming is called tetechercheuse.sln which is a Windows Form Application I built for my photographer girlfriend. She wanted to be able to record the models she is working with into a database and search through them according to some criteria such as location and eye color. My application does just that: It helps her retrieve her previously inserted model information with criteria-filtering queries.

I aim to develop beautiful and useful applications for the end users to make their best use of.
I am interested in contributing to helping projects other than my own. Hit me up anytime.
